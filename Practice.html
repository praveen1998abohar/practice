		<h2>Paragraph Tag</h2>
			<p>
			The topic sentence is the most important part of your paragraph; it tells the reader the general idea of your paragraphs and should essentially “hook” them into wanting to read more!Coherence is more commonly referred to as the flow of your writing. When a paragraph flows, the reader will
			be able to understand the main idea that you have presented. How can you ensure that your paragraph maintains a flow? Well, after presenting your main idea in your topic sentence, each sentence following must build upon each other in an organized manner. After writing your paragraph, go back and read aloud what you have written to make sure your ideas are clearly presented. If they are, you have developed a coherent paragraph!

			Now that your paragraph has a topic,       it is essential that this topic be sufficiently developed.         Do not limit yourself to a set number of sentences.        Yes, your paragraph should not be too short or too long,           but it should be an
			appropriate length to flesh out the entirety of your paragraph’s idea.       A reader should not be left with questions after a sufficiently development paragraph.            In order to achieve this, you can provide examples, cite work, provide necessary definitions, describe, analyze, and organize your ideas.
